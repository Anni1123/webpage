<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance">Insurance </a>
is a means of protection from financial loss. It is a form of risk management,
 primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.
An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company,
 insurance carrier or underwriter. A person or entity who buys insurance is 
 known as an insured or policyholder. The insurance transaction involves the
 insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of
 payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the
 insured in the event of a covered loss. The loss may or may not be financial, 
 but it must be reducible to financial terms, and usually involves something in
 which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership, possession,
 or preexisting relationship.The insured receives a contract, called the insurance 
 policy, which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will
 compensate the insured. The amount of money charged by the insurer to the insured for
 the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium. If the insured
 experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured 
 submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster. The insurer may hedge 
 its own risk by taking out reinsurance, whereby another insurance company agrees to carry
 some of the risk, especially if the risk is too large for the primary insurer to carry.
